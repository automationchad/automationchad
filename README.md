I'm a data engineer who builds reliable systems. I focus on:

- Core data pipeline architecture and distributed computing
- Data warehouse optimization and OLAP system design
- Schema evolution and data quality enforcement
- Production ETL orchestration and monitoring
- Scalable tools for data validation and real-time processing

I build minimal, focused data systems to understand fundamental concepts. When I don't understand something, I implement it from scratch to learn it.

Current interest: Real-time data processing for IoT/sensor networks, especially streaming analytics at scale.
