I'm a mechanical/hardware engineer who writes software. I focus on:

- Core mesh data structures and computational geometry
- Engineering visualization and technical rendering
- Geometric constraint solving and CAD foundations
- Field analysis and mechanical simulation
- Fast tools for structural validation and field manufacturing

I build minimal, focused libraries to understand fundamental concepts. When I don't understand something, I code it to learn it.

Current interest: Field manufacturing for drones/robots, especially rapid parts replacement.
