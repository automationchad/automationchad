I'm a mechanical/hardware engineer who writes software. I focus on:

- Graphics programming for particle simulations
- Physics and game engines
- Drone and terrain simulations
- Testing autonomous systems in simulated environments
- 3D design for defense applications

I build visual tools to help understand complex systems. When I don't understand something, I code it to learn it.

Current interest: Field manufacturing for drones/robots, especially rapid parts replacement.
